## Roadmap
Less of a roadmap, more of a feature list for v1.0 and a bit beyond. Vaguely in order of descending importance.

* Option to select a track from the playlist
* Favicon
* Display information on current track
* Toggle to switch between shuffle and non-shuffle
    * Including internal change to keep the entire order in memory instead of only the current index, so that shuffle plays every track only once
* Display information on selected track without immediately starting it
* General settings such as default volume
    * If possible, save settings in cookies
* Show track length in playlist and playlist length in selection
* Option to (not) loop playlist
* Make it prettier
* Multiple themes to choose from, possibly with custom themes
    * Also decide between using bootstrap fully or removing it
* Skip button
* Per-track volume settings (how these are determined is another matter)
* Stealth mode
